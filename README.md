# tic-tac-toe_ai

Utilize minimax algorithm to program computer AI

AI should play a perfect game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.

It's a small project I've personally created to practice good objected-oriented programming design.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------
1. AI should win against a novice human player
2. The game should end in a draw when playing against an experienced human player.


First Release - 9/10/2016
--------------------------------------------------------
1. See main.cpp for an example of a game driver
2. The computer plays a perfect game against a human player
3. It still requires input validation.
